# THIS SERVER DOES NOT WORK AT THIS TIME

# about project-zomboid-server

There are a few docker images circling the internet for running Project Zomboid in a container, but I wasn't satisfied with their implementations because they're architected to run on a persistent server rather than in a kubernetes cluster. I set out to create a lightweight, linuxgsm-free Project Zomboid Dockerfile and some associated manifests for running in Kubernetes.
